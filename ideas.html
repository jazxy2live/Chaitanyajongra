        A history of ideas I have worked upon. They are pivoted projects, but they add up to who I am.
        This is a collection of what I have built, explored, and learned from.

            A community platform for teenagers to find resources on mental health, personal growth, and peer support. We
            aimed to be a one-stop shop for solutions and tools.

            <span style="color: #666; font-style: italic;">(We were the Walmart for teenagers, except instead of
              products, we provided solutions. I pivoted because I didn't know how to navigate the execution—it was my

            A "no-social" app designed for Gen-Z to find meaningful friendships based on shared interests. The goal was
            to cut through the fluff of traditional social media and bridge the gap between acquaintances and true
            friends.

            An ambitious venture into AR social discovery that allowed users to connect with people and digital layers
            in the physical world. It aggregated various proximity-based interaction concepts.
